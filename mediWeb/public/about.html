      <h2 class="mg-story-title">Why <span class="mg-brand">MediGrant</span></h2>
      <div class="mg-story-card">
        <p>We started MediGrant after taking a Medical Device Innovation class at Stanford and realizing how broken the research grant process is, especially for small clinics and independent researchers. It's time-consuming, full of unclear requirements, and often requires hiring expensive consultants just to stand a chance.</p>
        <p>We've experienced this firsthand, doing research at Stanford, and kept hearing the same frustration from others: researchers wasting months just to figure out how to write the proper proposal. So we started asking questions: scientists, small clinic staff, VCs, etc, and everyone told us the same thing: the system is too hard to navigate, and it's keeping a lot of good science from getting funded.</p>
        <p>That's when we realized the core problem: there's over $84B in grant funding in healthcare in the U.S., but 77% of small-to-midsize healthcare orgs don't even apply because they don't know how or can't afford help. If you're not already in the system, you're locked out. That's what we're fixing.</p>
